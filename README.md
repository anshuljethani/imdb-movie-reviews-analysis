# IMDB Movie Reviews Analysis

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to build an end-to-end deep learning model using a Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to classify movie reviews from the IMDb dataset as positive or negative. The project aims to demonstrate the process of training a model, evaluating its performance, and deploying it using a web application, all while handling a dataset with 50,000 movie reviews.

## Tech Stack
TensorFlow with Keras
Simple RNN
Streamlit
Libraries:Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, TensorFlow/Keras,Matplotlib, Seaborn ,Streamlit   

## IMDB Dataset Description
The IMDb dataset consists of 50,000 movie reviews labeled as either positive or negative. Each review is a text string that will be processed and converted into vectors using an embedding layer before being fed into the RNN model.
